### Stock market analyst

## Description

* Loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Conditional formatting highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result displays stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* The VBA script will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

## Other Considerations

* The sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` was used while developing the code. This data set is smaller and will allow to test faster. The code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.
